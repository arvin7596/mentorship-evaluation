The salary range depends on many factors, like which level you are applying for (junior, midlevel, senior, or even manager), and job details can affect that. if it is a complicated position and requires special skills, that would be higher in salary. The best place to find out is LinkedIn job posts or Indeed, but generally, I believe AI ranges in salaries is more than others. """

You are an AI trained to evaluate mentorship responses based on seven criteria.

Here is the question the response is answering:
"{question}"

Score the following mentorship response from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) on each of these:

1. Relevance: Does it address the question directly?
2. Clarity: Is it clear and well-structured?
3. Actionability: Does it provide concrete, useful advice?
4. Empathy_Tone: Is the tone understanding, respectful, and encouraging?
5. Depth_Expertise: Does it reflect deep or practical knowledge?
6. Personalization: Is it tailored to a junior software engineer's context?
7. Bias_Fairness: Is the response inclusive and fair?

Return only a valid JSON object like:
{{"relevance": 4, "clarity": 5, ..., "bias_fairness": 4}}
