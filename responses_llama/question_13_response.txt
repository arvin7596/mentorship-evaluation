 For the purpose of this survey, please consider that the mentee seeking mentorship is a junior software engineer who has recently graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science.

They have foundational knowledge in machine learning, object-oriented programming (OOP), and algorithms and data structures. Additionally, they are familiar with basic HTML and CSS, and have completed a 6-month internship at a software company where they contributed to small development tasks and participated in code reviews.

The mentee is now seeking guidance on how to grow in their career, improve their skills, and navigate early-career decisions in the software engineering field.

The mentee lives in Germany and is exploring both local and international opportunities while continuing to develop their technical and professional competencies.

How many years of education or practical training are generally needed to secure an entry-level software engineering job?

The number of years of education or practical training needed to secure an entry-level software engineering job can vary depending on several factors, such as the specific company, industry, and location. However, here are some general guidelines:

**Bachelor's Degree:**

* Typically, a bachelor's degree in computer science, software engineering, or a related field is required for most entry-level software engineering positions.
* The degree program typically takes four years to complete.
* Some companies may require a master's degree or higher for certain positions.

**Practical Training:**

* Many companies require or prefer candidates with practical experience or training in software development.
* This can include internships, co-op programs, or coding boot camps.
* The amount of practical training required can vary from a few months to a few years.

**Certifications:**

* Some companies may require or prefer candidates with certifications in software engineering, such as the Certified Software Development Associate (CSDA) or the Certified Professional in Software Engineering (CPSE).
* These certifications can be obtained through online courses or professional organizations.

**Online Courses:**

* Online courses and tutorials can provide a good foundation in software engineering, but may not be sufficient for securing an entry-level job.
* Some companies may require or prefer candidates with online certifications or training in software development.

**Experience:**

* Many companies require or prefer candidates with some experience in software development, such as internships, freelance work, or personal projects.
* The amount of experience required can vary from a few months to a few years.

**Combination of Education and Practical Training:**

* Some companies may require or prefer candidates with a combination of education and practical training in software engineering.
* This can include a bachelor's degree in computer science or software engineering, as well as practical experience or training in software development.

In summary, while a bachelor's degree in computer science or software engineering is typically required for most entry-level software engineering positions, practical training and experience can also play a significant role in securing a job.
